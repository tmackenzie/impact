## Hi there! 👋

Hey, I'm Tom. I have lots of opinions mostly about tech and pottery. I've been a software developer for over 20 years, 
I've spent about 10-15 years at start-ups, and I'm currently a Principal Developer at a large company.

**TLDR**; I'm super smart, a bit grumpy, and not responsible if you get fired taking my advice.
