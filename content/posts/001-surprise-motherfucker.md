I've seen and heard of many stories where 1:1 feedback for the year is inconsistent with yearly reviews.

### What you can do
There's not much you can do to change the yearly results. If you are brave enough then you could try a few of these:
- Ask for documentation on how reviews are done. If your process was different from what is documented then raise that issue with your people leader and HR.
- Ask HR to explain the review process including how employees are evaluated.
- Reach out HR to learn how to petition the results.
- Share with your people leader and their leader about your confusion.
- In your upward feedback mention the inconsistency in your people leader's feedback.
- Start a mutiny. 
  - Ask your peers how they felt about the process.
  - Ask them how they plan to react.
- Ask how this review will impact your compensation and opportunity for promotions.
- Ask how you, your leaders, and HR can learn from it and improve it for next year.

Depending on your company culture these could harm you even if the style they are done is professional.
I've never seen a review change with attempting those strategies, I've tried a few times, and seen others make attempts.
If enough people make complaints then it's possible that HR will get involved and try to improve it for next year. 
I've seen that work once and the outcome was a documented career map. 

### Prepare for reactions from leadership 
To prepare for those discussion these are common reactions from leaders and HR:
- I think the best approach is to move forward.
- I don't think what you did was meets/exceeds
- Our organization failed to meet our goals.
- I thought you were a meets/exceeds, and I was forced by someone else to level you differently.

### Next year
First, understand why this happened which could be determined with the questions in [what you can do](#what-you-can-do). 

Companies that suffer from this is usually due to:
- Stack based ranking
- Small allotment for meets/exceeds leveling because your org failed.
- No career map.
- A manager that is bad at their role.
- Raising expectations for certain roles.

These environments require micromanaging your leader and their leader.
- Go to 1:1s with the tasks/projects you want to do (or have done) and have them rank them in priority and meet/exceeds.
- Learn how you are performing compared to your peers in 1:1s.
- Document 1:1s and share them with your people leader.
- Ask for updates on how the org is doing in 1:1s or town halls.
- Start skip level 1:1s.
- Tell HR and people leaders you'd like a career map.

### Realistic outcomes

Even with these approaches you may never feel valued. There may be people with less impact as you yet somehow get 
better yearly reviews. I suggest to blame the process not the people that get better results.
